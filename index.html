<div id="box1"> <h1>First Section</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Through this assignment I have had to learn many different terms and skills to produce this box. </p> </div>


<div id="box2"> <h1>Second Section</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p> It takes a lot of practice to learn all the things I need to be fluent in to create this kind of design. </p> </div>


<div id="box3"> <h1>Third Section</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p> It's not easy, but I do love it. I love learning and I like the challenge of creating something from lots of information that is difficult to remember. </p> </div>
